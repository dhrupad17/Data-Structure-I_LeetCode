# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
---
- ## Question:
> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
> 
> According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

- ## Example:

> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

- ## Solution:
**Code :**
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p.val<root.val && q.val<root.val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q);
        else if(p.val>root.val && q.val>root.val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q);
        else
            return root;
    }
}
